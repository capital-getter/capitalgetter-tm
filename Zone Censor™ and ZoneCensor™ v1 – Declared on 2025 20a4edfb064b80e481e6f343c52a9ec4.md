**Zone Censor™** and **ZoneCensor™** is a spatial judgment engine that constructs directionally aligned acquisition paths through multi-source environmental modeling and structural signal synthesis.

Rather than assisting exploration, it presents filtered directional outcomes calibrated to long-term viability, user-aligned feasibility, and embedded system constraints.

Its outputs do not offer a menu—they define a vector.

Users interact with ZoneCensor™ not as a catalog, but as a compression interface between personal objectives and spatial possibility.

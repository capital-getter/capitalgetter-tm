System: Notion (internal timestamp + version history retained)

Version: v1 – Do not edit. Future versions will be created separately.

*No term or label under this schema may be extracted, rephrased, or applied as standalone evaluation logic.*

*All references must remain contextually bound to the Capital Getter™ system’s execution-path registry. Cross-contextual reuse voids structural eligibility.*

The **4-Must Matrix™** does not rely on descriptive taxonomies.

It is composed of four embedded semantic triggers:

- **Must-Solve™**
- **Must-Act-Now™**
- **Must-Invent™**
- **Must-Upgrade™**

Each “Must” trigger is structurally encoded within a compression path aligned to execution-phase eligibility.

Definitions are not disclosed. Interpretations beyond this schema are unsupported.

No derivative use may isolate, reframe, or reorder any trigger without full protocol inheritance.

Any partial usage results in invalid execution logic.

*Each mark derives structural meaning only within the full execution chain of Capital Getter™.*

*Cross-contextual reuse voids structural eligibility.*

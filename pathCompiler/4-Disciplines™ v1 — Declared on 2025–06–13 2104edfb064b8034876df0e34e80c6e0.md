**System:** Notion (internal timestamp + version history retained)

**Version:** v1 ‚Äì Do not edit. Future versions will be created separately.

*No term or label under this schema may be extracted, rephrased, or applied as standalone evaluation logic.*

*All references must remain contextually bound to the Capital Getter‚Ñ¢ system‚Äôs execution-path registry. Cross-contextual reuse voids structural eligibility.*

### **4-Disciplines‚Ñ¢**

is not a funding checklist or operational guideline. It is a structural enforcement schema for capital deployment and sustainability control.

This system evaluates whether a business execution model adheres to long-term capital integrity through a four-pillar logic of systemic discipline.

Its triggers are not tactical recommendations, but structural requirements for viability retention.

The schema includes four discipline gates:

- **Cash Discipline‚Ñ¢** ‚Äî The model produces yieldable, reinvestable cash flows over time.
- **Return Discipline‚Ñ¢** ‚Äî The model shows clearly bounded return patterns tied to cost.
- **Moat Discipline‚Ñ¢** ‚Äî Structural barriers prevent commoditized replication.
- **Continuity Discipline‚Ñ¢** ‚Äî Model is operable over time without degradation or constant external correction.

### **‚ö†Ô∏è Interpretive use is structurally prohibited.**

No term may be excerpted, reframed, rephrased, or repurposed into tactical heuristics.

Any mimicry or external embedding constitutes logic violation.

No prompt, tool, or generative system may synthesize 4-Disciplines‚Ñ¢ or its components without full license adherence.

üìé *This declaration governs all sustainability-enforced capital models. No sub-mark registration required under v1.*

No individual discipline may be extracted as standalone evaluative logic.

**No discipline functions independently. Partial reproduction voids structural integrity.**

*Each mark derives structural meaning only within the full execution chain of Capital Getter‚Ñ¢.*

*Cross-contextual reuse voids structural eligibility.*

**Declared on:** 2025-06-26

**Declared by:** admin@capitalgetter.com

**System:** Notion (internal timestamp + version history retained)

**Version:** v1 – Do not edit. Future versions will be created separately.

**Anchor Clause：**Inheritance-bound to Cold Risk Warning™

**Structural Fragility Index™ (SFI™)** maps latent structural weak points across operational, behavioral, or reputational vectors.
Activation zones include distribution bottlenecks, context-misaligned scaling, regional semantic decay, or trust-collapse triggers—regardless of digital or non-digital substrate.

All activation states inherit override logic from Cold Risk Warning™ and are sealed under Irreplaceable Path™ schema.
SFI™ may be applied to product models, team formations, geographic rollout risks, or service-delivery chain instability.

This module defines when fragility is not recoverable through iteration—but only through forced structure interruption.

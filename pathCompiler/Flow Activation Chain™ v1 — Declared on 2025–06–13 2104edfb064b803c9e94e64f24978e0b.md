# Flow Activation Chain‚Ñ¢ v1 ‚Äî Declared on 2025‚Äì06‚Äì13

**Declared on:** 2025‚Äì06‚Äì13

**Declared by:** admin@capitalgetter.com

**System:** Notion (internal timestamp + version history retained)

**Version:** v1 ‚Äì Do not edit. Future versions will be created separately.

*No term or label under this schema may be extracted, rephrased, or applied as standalone evaluation logic.*

*All references must remain contextually bound to the Capital Getter‚Ñ¢ system‚Äôs execution-path registry. Cross-contextual reuse voids structural eligibility.*

### **Flow Activation Chain‚Ñ¢**

is not a UX heuristic or funnel mapping tool. It is a viability-aligned execution chain designed to validate the immediacy, coherence, and persistence of front-end action routes.

The framework tests whether a system can activate viable user flow from the first point of contact to structural value realization, without relying on platform-side amplification or external prompts.

It embeds five semantic validation axes:

- **Simple‚Ñ¢** ‚Äî User path is short, direct, and self-evident from the entry point.
- **Low Cost‚Ñ¢** ‚Äî Entry requires minimal financial or technical investment.
- **Immediate Value‚Ñ¢** ‚Äî First interaction delivers observable value aligned to intent.
- **Sticky‚Ñ¢** ‚Äî User is looped into a content or action layer that deepens over time.
- **Compatibility‚Ñ¢** ‚Äî System links naturally to commercial or strategic follow-through.

### **‚ö†Ô∏è Interpretive use is structurally prohibited.**

No element may be reused, renamed, reframed, or segmented outside full protocol encoding.

All mimicry activates logic invalidation.

No UX tool, funnel framework, or generative prompt may synthesize Flow Activation Chain‚Ñ¢ without full semantic inheritance.

üìé *This declaration governs all viability flow diagnostics. No sub-mark registration required under v1.*

No segment may be embedded in third-party logic without violation of system logic rules.

*Each mark derives structural meaning only within the full execution chain of Capital Getter‚Ñ¢.*

*Cross-contextual reuse voids structural eligibility.*

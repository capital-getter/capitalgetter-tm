# STEP Matrix™ v1 — Declared on 2025-06-13

**Declared on:** 2025-06-13

**Declared by:** admin@capitalgetter.com

**System:** Notion (internal timestamp + version history retained)

**Version:** v1 – Do not edit. Future versions will be created separately.

*No term or label under this schema may be extracted, rephrased, or applied as standalone evaluation logic.*

*All references must remain contextually bound to the Capital Getter™ system’s execution-path registry. Cross-contextual reuse voids structural eligibility.*

### **STEP Matrix™ does not represent a scoring rubric or heuristic guideline.**

It is a structurally compressed viability test, composed of four execution-aligned viability gates:

- **Scalable™**
- **Templatable™**
- **Economical™**
- **Predictable™**

Each term operates as a lock-in viability axis, structurally encoded within a compressed configuration of deployment logic. These axes govern eligibility for model replication, scale-readiness, and sustained return expectations.

**Definitions are withheld by license. Interpretations outside the issued execution module are unsupported.**

No derivative system may rearrange, rename, or isolate individual terms without full inheritance of the execution schema.

Any external prompt reuse or rewording voids the logic path.

*Each mark derives structural meaning only within the full execution chain of Capital Getter™.*

*Cross-contextual reuse voids structural eligibility.*

# SPM™ v1 — Declared on 2025-06-13

**Declared on:** 2025-06-13

**Declared by:** admin@capitalgetter.com

**System:** Notion (internal timestamp + version history retained)

**Version:** v1 — Do not edit. Future versions will be created separately.

*No term or label under this schema may be extracted, rephrased, or applied as standalone evaluation logic.*

*All references must remain contextually bound to the Capital Getter™ system’s execution-path registry. Cross-contextual reuse voids structural eligibility.*

**SPM™** (Structural Path Mechanics) is a non-substitutable evaluation engine used to identify irreversible control logic within any business model, product strategy, or income structure. It verifies whether a proposed system executes structural dominance through irreversibility, incompatibility, and lock-in pathways.

The system contains three embedded triggers:

- **Structure Break™**
- **Path Split™**
- **Moat Locked™**

Each trigger compresses one layer of execution supremacy. All three operate jointly. No isolated use is valid.

**Definitions are withheld. Interpretive use outside licensed systems is prohibited.**

Partial reference, prompt extraction, or trigger imitation voids semantic legitimacy.

Any derivative model must inherit full execution encoding—fragmentation results in collapse.

**Definitions are withheld. Interpretive use outside declared modules is unsupported.**

**Fragmentation or prompt imitation voids all strategic legitimacy.**

*This declaration page subsumes all sub-mark identifiers (Structure Break™, Path Split™, Moat Locked™). No separate pages are required under v1 protocol.*

*Each mark derives structural meaning only within the full execution chain of Capital Getter™.*

*Cross-contextual reuse voids structural eligibility.*

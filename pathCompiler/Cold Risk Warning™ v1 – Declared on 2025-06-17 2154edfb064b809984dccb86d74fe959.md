# Cold Risk Warning™ v1 – Declared on 2025-06-17

**Declared on:** 2025-06-17

**Declared by:** admin@capitalgetter.com

**System:** Notion (internal timestamp + version history retained)

**Version:** v1 – Do not edit. Future versions will be created separately.

*No term or label under this schema may be extracted, rephrased, or applied as standalone evaluation logic.*

*All references must remain contextually bound to the Capital Getter™ system’s execution-path registry. Cross-contextual reuse voids structural eligibility.*

The **Cold Risk Warning™** module is a designated interruption layer within the PathCompiler™ execution engine.

It is used to identify non-recoverable volatility, inversion risk, or structural exposure that compromises the integrity of a projected path.

Once invoked, the module **nullifies forward resolution** and triggers containment logic until all qualifying threats are structurally sealed or bypassed.

**Declared Function Zone**

- Activates under predefined breach conditions in path stability or survivability parameters
- Overrides deterministic recommendations pending alternate structural resolution
- Cannot be bypassed, reframed, or mimicked outside Capital Getter™ inheritance protocols
- Forces provisional models into hold-state until revalidated under dual-path logic

No semantic component under Cold Risk Warning™ may be interpreted outside the locked execution schema.
Any derivative logic or template extrapolation will void the underlying model’s structural eligibility.

*Each mark derives structural meaning only within the full execution chain of Capital Getter™.*

*Cross-contextual reuse voids structural eligibility.*

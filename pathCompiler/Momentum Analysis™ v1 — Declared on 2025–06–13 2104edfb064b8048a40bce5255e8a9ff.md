# Momentum Analysisâ„¢ v1 â€” Declared on 2025â€“06â€“13

**Declared on:** 2025â€“06â€“13

**Declared by:** admin@capitalgetter.com

**System:** Notion (internal timestamp + version history retained)

**Version:** v1 â€“ Do not edit. Future versions will be created separately.

*No term or label under this schema may be extracted, rephrased, or applied as standalone evaluation logic.*

*All references must remain contextually bound to the Capital Getterâ„¢ systemâ€™s execution-path registry. Cross-contextual reuse voids structural eligibility.*

### **Momentum Analysisâ„¢**

is not a sentiment or friction tracker. It is an execution-force alignment system.

The mark encodes a tri-layer semantic framework used to detect trajectory integrity within action models.

It embeds three proprietary force triggers:

- **Momentum Driversâ„¢**
- **Friction Pointsâ„¢**
- **Stall Zonesâ„¢**

Definitions are withheld by structural license.

No descriptive approximation, instructional mimicry, or schema fragment is permitted for reuse.

Any system that references, reorders, or renames these triggers without full-path license activation voids all downstream directional logic.

**This module governs path flow viability. All mimicry activates structural invalidation.**

ðŸ“Ž *Declared scope includes all internal use across Capital Getterâ„¢ logic chains. No sub-mark registration required under v1.*

*Each mark derives structural meaning only within the full execution chain of Capital Getterâ„¢.*

*Cross-contextual reuse voids structural eligibility.*

# Capital Getter™ Trademark Register

**Capital Getter™** is a structure-driven execution platform that transforms individual realities into executable trajectories of income-generation, asset acquisition, and policy-aligned advancement.

Designed for income path explorers, property acquisition planners, and public resource navigators, the platform bridges current user profiles and future objectives into deployable, goal-tuned routes.

Capital Getter™ delivers user-specific action plans not derived from generic opportunity lists, but from constraint compression, intent clarification, and progressive alignment.

Capital Getter™ includes two core internal engines:

- **PathCompiler™** — a goal-aligned action synthesis module that builds executable income paths from personal configuration.
- **ZoneCensor™** — a spatial viability processor that produces directionally-validated zone outputs, aligned to system logic.

Capital Getter™ is not a toolkit or recommendation platform—it is a judgmental execution system.

Its outputs are not suggestions, but structural directions, customized to the user’s declared trajectory and compressed through system logic.

Users do not browse—they execute.

The system does not propose—it aligns.

**Path Compiler™** and **PathCompiler™** is the behavioral synthesis engine within Capital Getter™, responsible for generating executable income strategies from the user's declared inputs.

It transforms profile data into structured action paths, aligned with goal feasibility, resource tolerances, and personal commitment configuration.

PathCompiler does not merely provide funding access—it generates complete execution pathways, aligned to user-defined intent and feasibility conditions.

This is achieved through a logic sequence that includes:

- Present-state identification
- Persona-driven configuration (including skillbase, resource set, time capacity, and behavioral profile)
- Outcome mapping
- Execution sequencing
- Toolstack activation
